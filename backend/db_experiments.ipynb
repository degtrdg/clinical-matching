Further testing now shows that it may suppress the growth of human cancer cells. Tests of DCA on human cells cultured outside of the body found that it killed lung, breast, and brain cancer cells, without affecting human normal cells. Tumors in rats that were infected with human tumors also shrank considerably. Most cancers are characterized by a resistance to apoptosis (cell death that removes abnormal cells) that makes them more likely to grow as well as be resistant to most cancer treatments. Plus, many current cancer treatments kill both cancerous and healthy cells and are highly toxic. DCA works by reversing the damage to the mitochondria that is present in cancer cells, thus reactivating the apoptosis (cell death) mechanism in them. The result is the death of the cancer cells. This mitochondrial reactivation presents an entirely new approach to treating cancer.\\n\\nDCA is known to be relatively well tolerated with few significant side effects and its selectivity, effectiveness and ease of delivery (oral) make it an attractive opportunity. It is hoped that one day this treatment may become a safe and effective treatment, either along or in conjunction with other treatments, for many forms of cancer.',\n",

Patients who\\nhave had chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, molecular targeted therapy, or radiotherapy within 4 weeks\\nprior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents\\nadministered more than 4 weeks earlier. 2. Patients may not be receiving any other investigational\\nagents, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, or molecular targeted agents. 3. Patients with\\nknown brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis\\nand because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that could confound the evaluation\\nof neurologic and other adverse events. 4. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of\\nsimilar chemical or biologic composition to DCA. 5. Due to the possibility of peripheral\\nsensorimotor neuropathy from DCA, the presence of grade 2 or higher peripheral neuropathy due to\\nprior medical condition (such as multiple sclerosis), medications, or other etiologies. 6. Any\\npsychological, familial, sociological, or geographical conditions that do not permit medical follow-\\nup and compliance with the study protocol. 7. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not\\nlimited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina\\npectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance\\nwith study requirements. Specifically, for patients who are taking either or both oral hypoglycemics\\nand insulin for diabetes mellitus will not be eligible as DCA in combination with these agents may\\nincrease the risk of clinically significant hypoglycemia, compromising patient safety. 8. Pregnant\\nwomen are excluded from this study because DCA is an agent with the potential for teratogenic or\\nabortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing\\ninfants secondary to treatment of the mother with DCA, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the\\nmother is treated with DCA. 9.

Deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, is the material that carries all the information about how a living thing will work and function. Everyone is born with the same DNA in all our cells throughout our body. Sometimes, some of the cells in the body develop abnormalities in the DNA that cause those cells to grow abnormally and uncontrollably. Cancer occurs when there is abnormal and uncontrolled growth of cells. The DNA in cancer cells is therefore different from the DNA someone is born with. The Signatera ctDNA assay is a laboratory test that takes tumor (cancer) tissue and evaluates it for unique tumor DNA. This evaluation is used to create a report (otherwise known as an assay) personalized to each person's cancer. The personalized assay creates a personalized blood test to detect the level of abnormal DNA from the cancer that may be circulating in the body. Once this personalized blood assay is designed, it may be used to monitor a person's blood for the presence of ctDNA, which will indicate the presence or absence of cancer over time, even after treatment.\",\n",

We will explore a range of factors to determine their role in both recovery of health and well-being and self-management. Although it is known that people who have had cancer are likely to experience a number of physical and psychological problems as a result of the disease and treatment, it is not known what the 'typical' course of recovery of health and well-being looks like, how long it takes and how this can be influenced. We will determine pathways to recovery of health and well-being following cancer diagnosis (initially breast cancer diagnosed \\\\<50 years, Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma and gynaecological cancers) and identify what factors influence this. This includes assessing the relative importance of the person's illness, personal attributes, perceived burden of treatment, role of the environment they live in, including health / social care and personal networks of support, and their ability and capacity to self-manage. We will identify who is most at risk of problems and what environmental supports and resources people are able to mobilise to support their self-management. We will also explore who has the confidence and ability to manage during and beyond treatment and what factors influence this and whether this leads to earlier problem resolution and restoration of health and well-being. This knowledge will be used to develop and test future supportive interventions to enhance the rapid recovery of health and well-being - our long term aim being to design ways of helping people with cancer in areas we identify as problematic for them.\",\n",

Relevant etiologic risk factor information is documented through review of pathology specimens and medical, vital, and genealogical records. Selected individuals and family members are asked to complete questionnaires and to undergo clinical evaluations specific for the tumor of interest. They are also asked to donate biologic specimens to be used in the search for cancer etiology and mechanisms of carcinogenesis. No therapy beyond counseling and education for cancer prevention, risk reduction, and early detection will be given.\\n\\nGenetic testing for tumor susceptibility gene(s) mutations and risk notification will be offered to study participants for whom a specific mutation predictive of disease has been identified in his/her family. This testing will only be offered when reasonable individual cancer risk estimates can be delivered, and only to those participants who choose to know their individual genetic status after appropriate education and counseling.

This study will focus on 5 tumor types which have been at the late stage or have spread to other parts of the body. These 5 tumor types are:\\n\\n* Non-small-cell-lung cancer\\n* Colorectal cancer (located in the intestine)\\n* Thyroid cancer\\n* Sarcomas (located in the connective tissue like bones or body fat)\\n* Salivary gland carcinoma\\n\\nIn some people with cancer, the cancer cells have specific changes in their building plans (genes) called NTRK gene fusion. NTRK stands for neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase, the specific gene that is changed. Due to this change in the gene, an altered protein known as a TRK fusion protein is made, which can cause cancer cells to grow and survive. While NTRK is the gene, TRK (tropomyosin receptor kinase) is the name of the protein. The specific cancer is therefore also called TRK fusion-positive cancer.\\n\\nThe study drug, larotrectinib works by blocking the altered TRK fusion protein. Larotrectinib is already available in the US, Europe, and in other countries and is approved for doctors to prescribe to patients with TRK fusion cancer.\\n\\nThe main purpose of this study is to learn more about how well larotrectinib works in adults with TRK fusion-positive cancer compared to other treatments. Researchers will compare how long participants who received larotrectninib lived to how long participants who received other treatments lived.

Many of these changes can be detected by directly examining parts of the cancer or cells in blood. Several alterations that occur repeatedly in certain types of blood cancers have already been identified, and these discoveries have led to the development of new drugs that target those alterations. More remain to be discovered.\\n\\nSome of these abnormalities include alterations in genes. Genes are the part of cells that contain the instructions which tell the investigators bodies how to grow and work, and determine physical characteristics such as hair and eye color. Genes are composed of DNA letters that spell out these instructions. Studies of the DNA molecules that make up the genes are called \"molecular\" analyses. Molecular analyses are ways of reading the DNA letters to identify errors in genes that may contribute to an increased risk of cancer or to the behavior of the cancer cells. Some changes in genes occur only in cancer cells. Others occur in the genes that are passed from parent to child. This research study will examine both kinds of genes. The best way to find these genes is to study large numbers of people. The investigators expect that as many 1000 individuals will enroll in this study.\\n\\nThis research study is trying to help doctors and scientists understand why cancer occurs and to develop ways to better treat and prevent it. To participate in this study the participant must have cancer now, had it in the past, or are at risk of developing cancer. The participant will not undergo tests or procedures that are not required as part of their routine clinical care.

Further testing now\\nshows that it may suppress the growth of human cancer cells. Tests of DCA on\\nhuman cells cultured outside of the body found that it killed lung, breast, and\\nbrain cancer cells, without affecting human normal cells. Tumors in rats that\\nwere infected with human tumors also shrank considerably. Most cancers are\\ncharacterized by a resistance to apoptosis (cell death that removes abnormal\\ncells) that makes them more likely to grow as well as be resistant to most\\ncancer treatments. Plus, many current cancer treatments kill both cancerous and\\nhealthy cells and are highly toxic. DCA works by reversing the damage to the\\nmitochondria that is present in cancer cells, thus reactivating the apoptosis\\n(cell death) mechanism in them. The result is the death of the cancer cells.\\nThis mitochondrial reactivation presents an entirely new approach to treating\\ncancer.  DCA is known to be relatively well tolerated with few significant side\\neffects and its selectivity, effectiveness and ease of delivery (oral) make it\\nan attractive opportunity. It is hoped that one day this treatment may become a\\nsafe and effective treatment, either along or in conjunction with other\\ntreatments, for many forms of cancer.\\nOfficial Title: A Phase I, Open-Labeled, Single-Arm, Dose Escalation, Clinical and Pharmacology\\nStudy of Dichloroacetate (DCA) in Patients With Recurrent and/or Metastatic\\nSolid Tumours\\nConditions:\\n• Neoplasms\\n\\nInterventions Description:\\n• Continuous daily oral dosage (bid).\\n\\nEligibility Criteria:\\nHealthy Volunteers: False\\nSex: ALL\\nMinimum Age: 18 Years\\nStandard Ages: ['ADULT', 'OLDER_ADULT']\\nInclusion Criteria:  1. Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed recurrent or\\nmetastatic solid tumours. All patients will have no meaningful therapies available to them including\\nhormone therapy, chemotherapy and targeted therapies. For the malignancies that have no proven\\ntherapy, they can be enrolled without any prior systemic therapy. 2. Four weeks must have elapsed\\nsince prior chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, targeted therapy, or radiation therapy. There is no\\nrestriction in the amount of bone marrow previously radiated. 3. Recovery to baseline or, at most,\\ngrade 1 of all drug-related toxicities due to prior chemotherapy, radiation, hormonal therapy, or\\nmolecular targeted therapy, except for alopecia. 4.

Cardiac ejection fraction by MUGA scan or\\nechocardiogram must be \\\\>50% for patients at baseline. 9. The effects of DCA on the developing human\\nfetus are unknown. For this reason and because DCA can be teratogenic, women of child-bearing\\npotential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (e.g.: hormonal or barrier method of\\nbirth control, abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation.

Patients who\\nhave had chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, molecular targeted therapy, or radiotherapy within 4 weeks\\nprior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents\\nadministered more than 4 weeks earlier. 2. Patients may not be receiving any other investigational\\nagents, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, or molecular targeted agents. 3. Patients with\\nknown brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis\\nand because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that could confound the evaluation\\nof neurologic and other adverse events. 4. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of\\nsimilar chemical or biologic composition to DCA. 5. Due to the possibility of peripheral\\nsensorimotor neuropathy from DCA, the presence of grade 2 or higher peripheral neuropathy due to\\nprior medical condition (such as multiple sclerosis), medications, or other etiologies. 6. Any\\npsychological, familial, sociological, or geographical conditions that do not permit medical follow-\\nup and compliance with the study protocol. 7. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not\\nlimited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina\\npectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance\\nwith study requirements. Specifically, for patients who are taking either or both oral hypoglycemics\\nand insulin for diabetes mellitus will not be eligible as DCA in combination with these agents may\\nincrease the risk of clinically significant hypoglycemia, compromising patient safety. 8. Pregnant\\nwomen are excluded from this study because DCA is an agent with the potential for teratogenic or\\nabortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing\\ninfants secondary to treatment of the mother with DCA, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the\\nmother is treated with DCA. 9. HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are\\nineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with DCA.

Personal and family medical history must be verified through questionnaires, interviews, and\\nreview of pathology slides and medical records. For familial neoplasms, two or more living affected\\ncases among family members are required. The types of familial tumors that we are currently actively\\naccruing include:  Familial Cancers: bladder, brain, chordoma, lung, nevoid basal cell carcinoma\\nsyndrome (NBCC)  Familial Benign Neoplasms: meningiomas, neurofibromatosis 2 (bilateral acoustic\\nneurofibromatosis)  The types of familial tumors under active accrual and study are predominantly\\ninvestigator-and hypothesis-driven. This approach permits GEB investigators to remain alert to the\\nopportunities afforded by clusters of rare tumors in families and individuals, and to be more\\nresponsive to the dynamic research priorities in cancer genetics.  EXCLUSION CRITERIA:  Referred\\nindividuals and families for whom reported diagnoses cannot be verified.  Inability to provide\\ninformed consent.

This study will\\nfocus on 5 tumor types which have been at the late stage or have spread to other\\nparts of the body. These 5 tumor types are:  * Non-small-cell-lung cancer *\\nColorectal cancer (located in the intestine) * Thyroid cancer * Sarcomas\\n(located in the connective tissue like bones or body fat) * Salivary gland\\ncarcinoma  In some people with cancer, the cancer cells have specific changes in\\ntheir building plans (genes) called NTRK gene fusion. NTRK stands for\\nneurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase, the specific gene that is changed. Due to\\nthis change in the gene, an altered protein known as a TRK fusion protein is\\nmade, which can cause cancer cells to grow and survive. While NTRK is the gene,\\nTRK (tropomyosin receptor kinase) is the name of the protein. The specific\\ncancer is therefore also called TRK fusion-positive cancer.  The study drug,\\nlarotrectinib works by blocking the altered TRK fusion protein. Larotrectinib is\\nalready available in the US, Europe, and in other countries and is approved for\\ndoctors to prescribe to patients with TRK fusion cancer.  The main purpose of\\nthis study is to learn more about how well larotrectinib works in adults with\\nTRK fusion-positive cancer compared to other treatments. Researchers will\\ncompare how long participants who received larotrectninib lived to how long\\nparticipants who received other treatments lived. To do this, larotrectinib data\\nfrom past clinical studies will be compared with data on other treatments\\ngathered from different health data sources. The data will cover the time\\nbetween January 2013 and end of August 2022.  Besides this data collection, no\\nfurther tests or examinations are planned and no visits are required in this\\nstudy.\\nOfficial Title: Comparative Effectiveness Study of Real-world Control of TRK Fusion Positive\\nCancer With Patients From Larotrectinib (Vitrakvi) Clinical Trials\\nConditions:\\n• Solid Tumors Harboring NTRK Fusion\\n\\nInterventions Description:\\n• Clinical trials • Real word data\\n\\nEligibility Criteria:\\nHealthy Volunteers: False\\nSex: ALL\\nMinimum Age: 18 Years\\nStandard Ages: ['ADULT', 'OLDER_ADULT']\\nInclusion Criteria:  * Diagnosis of advanced stage of disease or metastatic disease.

Many of these changes can be detected by directly examining parts of\\nthe cancer or cells in blood. Several alterations that occur repeatedly in\\ncertain types of blood cancers have already been identified, and these\\ndiscoveries have led to the development of new drugs that target those\\nalterations. More remain to be discovered.  Some of these abnormalities include\\nalterations in genes. Genes are the part of cells that contain the instructions\\nwhich tell the investigators bodies how to grow and work, and determine physical\\ncharacteristics such as hair and eye color. Genes are composed of DNA letters\\nthat spell out these instructions. Studies of the DNA molecules that make up the\\ngenes are called \"molecular\" analyses. Molecular analyses are ways of reading\\nthe DNA letters to identify errors in genes that may contribute to an increased\\nrisk of cancer or to the behavior of the cancer cells. Some changes in genes\\noccur only in cancer cells. Others occur in the genes that are passed from\\nparent to child. This research study will examine both kinds of genes. The best\\nway to find these genes is to study large numbers of people. The investigators\\nexpect that as many 1000 individuals will enroll in this study.  This research\\nstudy is trying to help doctors and scientists understand why cancer occurs and\\nto develop ways to better treat and prevent it. To participate in this study the\\nparticipant must have cancer now, had it in the past, or are at risk of\\ndeveloping cancer.
